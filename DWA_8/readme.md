- challenge 1 
  use encapsulation on the book preview to make it more reusable?

## how was encapsulation implemented
![image](./img/after%20encapsulation.png)
the entire DOM manipulation was put inside a arrow function called preview so that whenever
the function of "preview" would run it would return the "starting" const after the data
was added and appended to the document.
